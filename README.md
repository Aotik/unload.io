Unload is an open-source code sharing platform, built in Node JS with a React JS frontend.

## Why did I build Unload?
The aim of Unload is to provide rapid fast code sharing facilites with auto-language syntax detection for anyone looking to distribute snippets of code.

## What's next?
In upcoming versions of Unload, I'm looking to implement live collaboration on pastes of code. This will take some time to ensure that I keep my vision of making Unload as efficient as possible; which is also another factor I'm looking to improve on.
